# 3018 CNC Meanwell LRS-350 Case

A case to mount the PSU and Controller to a 3018 CNC to upgrade the board and PSU.

I wanted to build PCB's using Easy-EDA and FlatCam so I needed a more accurite controller. I built this to hold the updates and clean up the wire mess as it was rather unsafe to begin with. 

## Features:
The PCB mount holds (1) Biqu SKR Pico and (1) Raspberry PI 3b.
For ease and safety the case has a lighted when on main switch.
The power inlet was from an Ender 5 plus. 
The Drag chain keeps the main wires safe. 

## Setup:
I have the RPI with Ser2Net for remote control allowing IOSender and Laser GBRL control.

The SKR Pico is flashed to the grblHAL to give common controls.
